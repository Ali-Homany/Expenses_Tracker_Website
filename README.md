# Expenses_Tracker_Website
Track your expenses using a simple minimalistic website, that summarizes everything in a pie chart and bar chart, with the ability to search through records and filter charts accordingly.

This is a CRUDS project using DOM local storage, built mainly for usage on desktop, using:
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for website design
- Javascript
- React JS
- Vanilla CSS

Note that data is locally saved on your device, it is totally safe to use this website, as no backend is included at all.

You can find & use the website [here](https://homanydata.github.io/Expenses_Tracker_Website/)
